# GCode_Robotic_Arm_2017
This project was completed. However, do to a flash drive problem the complete project was lost. Here is what I have to show. I would re-complete the project but I do not have one of these robotic arms availible. If anyone wants proof of completion I can get a letter from my professor. 
Parts not completed in this version:
Robo1.cpp: This would have been the driver for the project.
Rhino.cpp: This is the controlling class for the Rhino(the arm) and the moveInArc() function has not been finished in this version.

Here is two links to videos showing the projects tests. This project represents OO organization.
