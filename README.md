# GCode_Robotic_Arm_2017
This project was completed but in its current state on the repo it is near completion. This is because of a flash drive problem. I am attempting to finish the final Robo1.cpp to be a completed driver.
Here is two links to videos showing the projects tests. This project represents OO organization.
